<p>SMARTA is a smart object shaped like a ball, to be used by children or during team-building activities. It is designed to help enhance group discussions by complementing our natural approach to turn-taking, and it gives visual and haptic feedback. Also, it makes use of gamification to provide a more engaging user experience.</p>

<p>SMARTA helps each participant regulate the time they speak, by implementing a timer mechanism and signalling to the user, through light and vibration, when their turn to speak is about to end. Â The ball detects when it is passed to another user through an accelerometer and it resets the timer for
a new turn.Â </p>

<p>SMARTA also provides a web interface for the educator to set turn duration times and warn the students by making the ball emit red light when they speak over each other. Â The web interface also allows to consult statistics of past discussions. Â The core of SMARTA is a Raspberry Pi Zero, to which are connected Â a Â strip Â of Â LED Â lights Â and an Â accelerometer, Â as Â well Â as Â a Â vibration motor; SMARTA is programmed in Python.</p>
