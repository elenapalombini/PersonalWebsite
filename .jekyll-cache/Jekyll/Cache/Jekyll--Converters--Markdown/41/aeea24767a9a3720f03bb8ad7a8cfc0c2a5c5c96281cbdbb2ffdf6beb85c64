<p>Figma Project, whereÂ we designed the user interface of the website.</p>

<p>In a 2-people team, we developed an example website for a neighborhood volunteering association.
For the backend of our application, we used:
OpenApi specification for REST API
Node JS server framework
Javascript language
PostgreSQL Database (managed locally with PGAdmin)
Knex.js query builder
Heroku cloud platform to host the application and the database</p>
