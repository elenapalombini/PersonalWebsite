I"><p>My Master’s Thesis with Polytechnic University of Milan (PoliMi) and KTH is in progress, and it is a comparative study on flow in virtual reality experiences.</p>

<p>It is conducted with the support of the company <a href="https://xplorxr.dk/" target="_blank">Xplor XR</a>.</p>

<p>This thesis aims to explore the amount of “flow” induced by Virtual Reality experiences with different characteristics. For flow, we intend the term coined by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi in 1975 and belonging to the field  of  positive  psychology, that describes an ”optimal experience” wherein  individuals  are  totally  immersed  in an activity and experience it as positive  and rewarding<a href="#ref">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>The research questions that will be examined are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Is there a measurable difference in the flow experience brought about by a  task  in  Virtual  Reality  compared  to  the  same  one  on  a  2D  computer screen?</li>
  <li>Which characteristics make a VR experience more effective in bringing about flow?</li>
</ul>

<p>The participants to the study will be asked to wear a Virtual Reality head-mounted display (Oculus Quest) and will experience one of the VR scenarios. A set of participants will experience one of the scenarios through a 2D computer screen.</p>

<p>Then, they will be given the Flow State Scale (FSS-2) questionnaire developed by Jackson and Eklund<a href="#ref">[2]</a>, which is a componential approach which presents flow as a multifaceted construct, with 9 components evaluated subjectively through Likert scales. The 9 components follow Jackson and Marsh’s<a href="#ref">[3]</a> and Jackson and Csikszentmihalyi’s<a href="#ref">[4]</a> definition of flow and are: focused concentration on the present activity, sense of control over one’s actions, merging of action and awareness, autotelic experience, loss of self-consciousness, loss of time-awareness or time acceleration, clear proximal goals, unambiguous feedback, dynamic balance between challenge and skill.</p>

<p>Lastly, the results of the Flow State Scale will be analysed to evaluate whether there is a clear difference in flow experience in the different VR scenarios, and if they overall induce more flow than the 2D computer screen scenario.</p>
