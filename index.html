        <p>
            I am passionate about UX research because it combines analytical discovery of insights and psychological skills like understanding, empathizing, and talking to people.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>I have experience in several different research methods: interviews, usability tests, A/B testing. I have extensively utilised all of these methods in my experience at <a href="https://bendingspoons.com/" target="_blank">Bending Spoons</a>, a leading mobile app developer in Europe.</li>
            <li>I have also practiced quantitative and qualitative methods while conducting <a href="/portfolio/master_thesis/">my research in the field of Virtual Reality</a>, that I have presented at a major international Cyberpsychology research conference (CYPSY26). That experience allowed me to sharpen my presentation and communication skills, and to present my findings to a wide audience.</li>
            <li>I have a <strong>Master's Degree in Human-Computer Interaction and Design</strong>. My education also gave me a deep knowledge of design methods such as Design Thinking, Human-centered design, but also advanced user interfaces and research methods. My <strong>Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Engineering</strong> helped me build a solid framework of tech knowledge and analytical thinking.</li>
            <li>I'm open-minded and willing to learn and challenge myself. I am very communicative and open to feedback, and this allows me to continuously grow my skills. I value hard work, kindness and communication.</li>
        </ul>
