Created for the course "Designing Digital Business Innovation Labs" at Polytechnic University of Milan - the company supervisors for this project were from the company Sony Music Entertainment.

The aim of the project was to better understand the recent explosion of TikTok’s success and to help Sony Music define a strategy to scout emerging artists and to promote Sony’s ones through this channel. 

We performed business analysis through a variety of tools (PEST Analysis, Porter's Value Chain, SWOT Analysis, Lean Canvas, Customer Segment Analysis, Customer Personas).
Then, we proposed two different solutions for the outlined goals - scouting emerging talents and song promotion through TikTok.

Here is the full document detailing our strategy and data analysis tool that we devised:
