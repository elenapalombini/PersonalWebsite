### Overview

This research was originally conducted for my Master’s Thesis at Polytechnic University of Milan (PoliMi) and KTH Royal Institute of Technology (Stockholm, Sweden), with the support of the company <a href="https://xplorxr.dk/" target="_blank">Xplor XR</a>.

I presented this work at <a href="https://www.interactivemediainstitute.com/cypsy26/" target="_blank">CYPSY26 (26th Annual CyberPsychology, CyberTherapy & Social Networking Conference)</a>  in Paris. I also condensed the findings into a paper that was then chosen for publication in the <a href="https://www.arctt.info/" target="_blank">Annual Review of Cybertherapy and Telemedicine</a>.

Here is the abstract of my research:

> Flow state is a state of intense focus and engagement, which is fulfilling for people experiencing it and therefore sought-after by creators of virtual games and experiences. As theorized by Csíkszentmihályi, flow can be subdivided into nine components: merging of actions and awareness, clear goals, concentration on the task at hand, unambiguous feedback, challenge-skill balance, transformation of time, sense of control, loss of self-consciousness, and autotelic experience. 
> Virtual Reality (VR) is known to be one of the most immersive technologies available today. As such, it has great potential to foster flow state in its users. 
> This work tries to determine which design characteristics favor flow the most in VR, with respect to providing guidance to the user. In particular, this research examines **whether text hints or glowing cues are more effective to foster feelings of flow in a VR escape room**. The intensity of flow state has been evaluated through the Activity Flow State Scale (AFSS) designed by Payne et al., and qualitative data has also been gathered, from direct observation and user comments. 
> AFSS score, duration of the VR experience, and duration estimated by the participants, have been compared between the version of the VR escape room which presents hints as text prompts and the one in which relevant objects glow. This data has then been connected to findings resulting from the thematic analysis of direct observation and user comments. The results did not provide a clear indication that either of the hint versions distinctly produced more flow, but rather that they both acted in different ways on separate flow components. In particular, the component "clear goals" had a higher average score for the version of the escape room with text hints. The qualitative data also gave rise to several insights into the complexities of designing Virtual Reality experiences to foster flow.

My Master’s Thesis with Polytechnic University of Milan (PoliMi) and KTH is in progress, and it is a comparative study on flow in virtual reality experiences.


It is conducted with the support of the company <a href="https://xplorxr.dk/" target="_blank">Xplor XR</a>.

This thesis aims to explore the amount of “flow” induced by Virtual Reality experiences with different characteristics. For flow, we intend the term coined by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi in 1975 and belonging to the field  of  positive  psychology, that describes an ”optimal experience” wherein  individuals  are  totally  immersed  in an activity and experience it as positive  and rewarding<a href="#ref">[1]</a>. 

The research questions that will be examined are:
- Is there a measurable difference in the flow experience brought about by a  task  in  Virtual  Reality  compared  to  the  same  one  on  a  2D  computer screen?
- Which characteristics make a VR experience more effective in bringing about flow?

The participants to the study will be asked to wear a Virtual Reality head-mounted display (Oculus Quest) and will experience one of the VR scenarios. A set of participants will experience one of the scenarios through a 2D computer screen.

Then, they will be given the Flow State Scale (FSS-2) questionnaire developed by Jackson and Eklund<a href="#ref">[2]</a>, which is a componential approach which presents flow as a multifaceted construct, with 9 components evaluated subjectively through Likert scales. The 9 components follow Jackson and Marsh’s<a href="#ref">[3]</a> and Jackson and Csikszentmihalyi’s<a href="#ref">[4]</a> definition of flow and are: focused concentration on the present activity, sense of control over one’s actions, merging of action and awareness, autotelic experience, loss of self-consciousness, loss of time-awareness or time acceleration, clear proximal goals, unambiguous feedback, dynamic balance between challenge and skill.

Lastly, the results of the Flow State Scale will be analysed to evaluate whether there is a clear difference in flow experience in the different VR scenarios, and if they overall induce more flow than the 2D computer screen scenario.
