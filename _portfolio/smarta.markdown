SMARTA is a smart object shaped like a ball, to be used by children or during team-building activities. It is designed to help enhance group discussions by complementing our natural approach to turn-taking, and it gives visual and haptic feedback. Also, it makes use of gamification to provide a more engaging user experience.


SMARTA helps each participant regulate the time they speak, by implementing a timer mechanism and signalling to the user, through light and vibration, when their turn to speak is about to end.  The ball detects when it is passed to another user through an accelerometer and it resets the timer for
a new turn. 


SMARTA also provides a web interface for the educator to set turn duration times and warn the students by making the ball emit red light when they speak over each other.  The web interface also allows to consult statistics of past discussions.  The core of SMARTA is a Raspberry Pi Zero, to which are connected  a  strip  of  LED  lights  and an  accelerometer,  as  well  as  a  vibration motor; SMARTA is programmed in Python.
