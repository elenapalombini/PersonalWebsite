Research project conducted for the course "Research Methodology and Scientific Writing" at KTH Royal Institute of Technology.

This paper has two main objectives: 
- Firstly, the categorization of the interactions that have been affected by the Coronavirus pandemic and the new challenges and possible solutions. 
- Secondly, the collection and analysis of data from interviews with people in the field, which will give insights into the future direction and trends in Interaction Design.
